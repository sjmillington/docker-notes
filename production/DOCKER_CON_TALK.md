## DockerCon Talk

Best Practices and stuff

- Watch out for scope creep, don't introduce everything at once.
- Things you might not need for V1:
  - CI/CD
  - Dynamic performance scaling
  - Containerizing EVERYTHING

- Legacy apps work in containers too.

- Focus on Dockerfiles first - these are now your build documentation
  - Move all of your build shell scripts + stuff into it.
  - Comment it.
  - Make it clean/scale/log things
  - Log all things in stdout/stderr
